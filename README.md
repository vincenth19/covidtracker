# [CovidTracker](https://covidtracker.pages.dev)

Hi everyone, my name is Vincent and I am a front-end developer. \
I made this project as a hobby project for my portfolio. \
I wanted to make a COVID-19 website in Indonesia that is good looking yet informative. \

Please star this project if you find it useful or interesting!

- COVID-19 data is sourced from [my proxy backend](https://github.com/vincenth19/covidtracker-backend)
- Vaccination data is taken from [Cekdiri's API](https://cekdiri.id/vaksinasi/)
- Infectivity rate and other statistic is taken from [Ministry of Health website embedded Tableau](https://vaksin.kemkes.go.id/#/scprovinsi)

CovidTracker was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and deployed to [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com)
